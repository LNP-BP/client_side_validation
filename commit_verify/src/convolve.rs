/// Trait for *convolve-commit-verify scheme*, where some data structure (named
/// *container*) may commit to existing *message* using *supplement* and
/// producing final *commitment* value. The commitment can't be used to restore
/// original message, however the fact of the commitment may be
/// deterministically *verified* when the message and the supplement (now acting
/// as a *proof*) proof are *revealed*.
///
/// In other words, *convolve-commit* takes an object (`self`), a *supplement*,
/// convolves them in certain way together and than uses the result to produce a
/// commitment to a *message* and a *proof*:
/// - `self + supplement -> internal_repr`;
/// - `internal_repr + msg -> (commitment, proof)`.
///
/// Later on, a verifier presented with a message and the proof may do the
/// commitment verification in the following way: `msg, proof, commitment ->
/// bool`.
///
/// To use *convolve-commit-verify scheme* one needs to implement this trait for
/// a data structure acting as a container for a specific commitment under
/// certain protocol, specified as generic parameters. The container type must
/// specify commitment types as associated type [`Self::Commitment`]. The
/// commitment type in certain cases may be equal to the original container
/// type; when the commitment represents internally modified container.
///
/// The difference between *convolve-commit-verify* and *embed-commit-verify*
/// schemes is in the fact that unlike embed-commit, convolve-commit does not
/// produce a proof external to the commitment, but instead requires additional
/// immutable supplement information which is not a part of the container
/// converted into the commitment. As an example one may consider procedures of
/// homomorphic public key tweaking with the hash of the message, which is
/// a case of embed-commit procedure, producing original public key as a proof
/// and tweaked public key as a commitment -- and procedure of pay-to-contract
/// commitment in scriptPubkey of a transaction output, which requires
/// additional information about the public key or scripts present in the
/// scriptPubkey only in hashed form (this is *supplement*), and producing just
/// a modified version of the scriptPubkey (commitment) without any additional
/// proof data.
///
/// Operations with *convolve-commit-verify scheme* may be represented in form
/// of `ConvolveCommit: (Container, Supplement, Message) -> Commitment` (see
/// [`Self::convolve_commit`] and
/// `Verify: (Container', Supplement, Message) -> bool` (see
/// [`ConvolveCommitProof::verify`]).
///
/// This trait is heavily used in **deterministic bitcoin commitments**.
///
/// # Protocol definition
///
/// Generic parameter `Protocol` provides context & configuration for commitment
/// scheme protocol used for this container type.
///
/// Introduction of this generic allows to:
/// - implement trait for foreign data types;
/// - add multiple implementations under different commitment protocols to the
///   combination of the same message and container type (each of each will have
///   its own `Proof` type defined as an associated generic).
///
/// Usually represents an uninstantiable type, but may be a structure
/// containing commitment protocol configuration or context objects.
///
/// ```
/// # use commit_verify::CommitmentProtocol;
