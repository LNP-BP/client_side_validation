This is an implementation defining standard of client-side-validation
representing a set of its Foundation libraries. The standards covered by the
libraries include [LNPBP-4], [LNPBP-7], [LNPBP-8], [LNPBP-9], and [LNPBP-81]
(see [Components](#components) section below for more details).

Client-side-validation is a paradigm for distributed computing, based on top of
proof-of-publication/commitment medium layer, which may be a bitcoin blockchain
or other type of distributed consensus system.

The development of the library is supported by [LNP/BP Standards Association][lnpbp-web]
and is performed on its [GitHub page][lnpbp-github].

The original idea of client-side-validation was proposed by Peter Todd with its
possible applications designed by Giacomo Zucco. It was shaped into the protocol
design by Dr Maxim Orlovsky with a big input from the community.

Minimum supported rust version for the library (MSRV) is 1.66 and 2021 rust
edition.

## Documentation

Detailed developer & API documentation for all libraries can be accessed at:

- <https://docs.rs/client_side_validation/>
- <https://docs.rs/single_use_seals/>
- <https://docs.rs/commit_verify/>

To learn about the technologies enabled by the library please check
[slides from our tech presentations][presentations] and
[LNP/BP tech talks videos][lnpbp-youtube].

## Components

This library consists of the following main three components, which define
independent parts constituting together client-side-validation API and its core
functionality. These are:

- [Commit-verify](commit_verify/README.md) client-side-validation-specific APIs:
    * consensus commitments (part of [LNPBP-8] standard)
    * multi-commitments ([LNPBP-4] standard)
    * merklization for client-side-validation ([LNPBP-81] standard)
- [Single-use-seals](single_use_seals/README.md) API ([LNPBP-8] standard)
- Client-side-validation API from the library root, linking those components
  together according to [LNPBP-9] standard.

## Usage

The repository contains rust libraries for client-side validation.

### Use library in other projects

To use libraries, you just need latest version of libraries, published to
[crates.io](https://crates.io) into `[dependencies]` section of your project
`Cargo.toml`. Here is the full list of available libraries from this repository:

```toml
client_side_validation = "1" # "Umbrella" library including all of the tree libraries below
commit_verify = "1" # Consensus and multi-message commitments
single_use_seals = "1" # Generic (non-bitcoin-specific) API
```

"Umbrella" `client_side_validation` library is configured with default set of
features enabling all of its functionality (and including all of other libraries
from this repository, listed above). If you need to restrict this set, either
use specific libraries - or configure main library with a set of features in
the following way:

```toml
[dependencies.client_side_validation]
version = "1"
default-features = false
features = [] # Your set of features goes here
```

The library has four feature flags, all of which are not used by default:

- `rand`, providing support for generating random 32-byte sequences of `Slice32`
  type, used in many LNP/BP applications (for instance as hash-lock preimages or
  during LNPBP-4 multi-commitments);
- `serde`, providing support for data structure serialization with serde across
  all library.

For specific features which may be enabled for the libraries, please check
library-specific guidelines, located in `README.md` files in each of library
subdirectories.

### Libraries based on client-side-validation

Most of the developers will be probably interested in a more high-level
libraries based on client-side-validation, applying it to a specific commitment
mediums (bitcoin transaction graph from blockchain or state channels, or more
exotic systems like confidential bitcoin transactions used by elements & liquid,
or mimblewimble-based systems). Here is (potentially incomplete) list of such
libraries:

- Bitcoin: [BP Core Lib](https://github.com/LNP-BP/bp-core), which contains
  bitcoin UTXO single-use-seal implementations for pay-to-contract and
  sign-to-contract types of seals, as well as a library for deterministic
  bitcoin commitments. This library is maintained by LNP/BP Association.
- [Pandora sealchain](https://github.com/pandora-network/sealchain-rs), an
  experimental blockchain of [Pandora Network](https://pandora.network),
  playing with client-side-validation using modified bitcoin consensus rules,
  extended with eltoo- and covenants-related functionality and with removed
  native blockchain-level coin.
