//! The LNP/BP client-side-validation foundation libraries implementing LNPBP
//! specifications & standards (LNPBP-4, 7, 8, 9, 81).
//!
//! Defines core interfaces from LNPBP standards specifying secure and robust
//! practices via well-format APIs. Consists of the following main components:
//! * Client-side validation
//! * Cryptographic commitments and verification
//! * Single-use-seals
//! * Strict binary data serialization used by client-side validation
//!
//! The goal of this module is to maximally reduce the probability of errors and
//! mistakes within particular implementations of this paradigms by
//! standardizing typical workflow processes in a form of interfaces that
//! will be nearly impossible to use in a wrong way.
